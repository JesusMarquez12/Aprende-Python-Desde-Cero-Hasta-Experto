# Python Naming Rules

## Strict Rules

- Variables name allow the use of alphanumeric characters and underscores.
- Variable name cannot start with numbers.
- Language keywords cannot be used. i.e. **for**, **if**, **class**, **try**, etc.
- Variable name are caps sensitive. i.e. **my_variable != My_Variable**

## Convention Rules

- Snake case use is advised (use only minuscule and use underscore to represent separations)
- Is recommended the use of descriptive name, that reflect the content of the variable.
- Avoid the use of single character variables.
